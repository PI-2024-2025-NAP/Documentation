# Project Abstract

**AI-Powered Platform for Smart City Issue Detection & Resolution** allows both citizens and sensors distributed across the city to submit event photos, which are analyzed using computer vision models to classify incidents and determine their locations. Additionally, autonomous sensor-equipped vehicles and urban cameras confirm incident resolutions, ensuring up-to-date information. The solution includes a **mobile application** for citizens and a **web platform** for municipal authorities, facilitating real-time monitoring, automated classification, and efficient event management.

**Key Challenges:**

- **AI integration**: AI-powered image analysis and real-time verification improve the precision of incident categorization.
- **ATCLL integration**: Smart sensors and automated image recognition validate incidents, ensuring up-to-date and accurate status tracking.
- **Privacy**: Data security and compliance are essential to protect user information.

The project also focuses on designing an adaptable architecture for integration with existing platforms and conducting usability tests to meet user needs effectively.
