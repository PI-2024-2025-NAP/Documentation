The design and development of the **AI-Powered Platform for Smart City Issue Detection & Resolution** were supported by several Personas that represent the key users of the application. These include:

- **João**, a Local Resident (Box 1)
- **Ana**, a Municipal Employee (Box 2)
- **Ricardo**, a System Administrator (Box 3)

## Box 1. João, a Local Resident

![João, a Local Resident](/img/personas/citizen.jpg)

**João** is a 35-year-old local resident who frequently commutes within the city and wants to contribute to the improvement of urban safety by reporting incidents such as potholes, accidents, or vandalism.

João is **frustrated** with unresponsive, slow, and impractical municipal services when reporting issues. He also finds it difficult to track the resolution of reported problems, leading to a sense of inefficiency in city maintenance.

**NEEDS**: João wants an **easy-to-use and fast mobile app** to submit incident reports. He also needs **feedback** on whether the incident has been addressed and the ability to **check the status** of his reported issues, as well as a history of past reports.

## Box 2. Ana, a Municipal Employee

**Ana** is a 45-year-old municipality employee working in the city's urban management department, monitoring reports and verifying incidents before dispatching repair crews.

Ana faces **challenges** such as a high volume of duplicate and decoupled reports, difficulty in prioritizing incidents needing urgent attention, and problems in categorizing incidents effectively. She also struggles with the lack of live updates on incident verification and resolution status, as well as the absence of an automated system to filter, validate, and cluster similar reports.

**NEEDS**: Ana requires an **organized system** that categorizes and groups reports by location to facilitate efficient assignment of repair teams. She needs a **map-based interface** providing an overview of city-wide issues to enhance situational awareness and decision-making. A **priority ranking system** would help her highlight urgent or recurrent problems. Additionally, she needs a **real-time dashboard** displaying statistics on resolved issues, urgent cases, and remaining incidents. Automated verification tools, such as sensor-equipped vehicles or cameras, would further streamline the process by confirming incident resolutions.

## Box 3. Ricardo, the System Administrator

**Ricardo** is a 30-year-old system administrator responsible for monitoring the overall health and performance of the urban incident management system. He ensures that the platform runs smoothly, oversees data processing efficiency, and manages access to system resources. He also troubleshoots technical issues and ensures compliance with data security policies.

Ricardo faces **challenges** such as difficulty in monitoring system performance in real time, lack of visibility into API usage and potential bottlenecks, and challenges in tracking the efficiency of AI-based image analysis and incident verification. Additionally, he has security concerns related to unauthorized API access or data breaches.

**NEEDS**: Ricardo requires a **dashboard** displaying key system metrics, such as the number of incidents reported, processed, and resolved over time. He also needs **performance analytics** on AI-based image recognition, including processing time per image and accuracy statistics. **API monitoring** is essential for tracking request rates, response times, and potential failures in data retrieval or submission. Furthermore, he needs **access control management** to configure and monitor user roles and permissions for different system users. Automated **alerts** for detecting unusual activity, such as sudden spikes in report submissions or slow AI processing times, would help maintain security and efficiency. Lastly, Ricardo needs **incident log history** for tracking system downtimes, errors, and processing delays, along with **system resource monitoring** for server load, storage capacity, and database query efficiency.
