## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a collaborative platform for the AI-powered submission, aggregation, classification, automatic detection, and resolution of incidents using the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab (ATCLL). The platform will allow both citizens and sensors distributed throughout the city to submit event photos, which will be automatically analyzed using computer vision models to identify the type of incident and its location. In the case of sensors, the resolution of incidents can also be reported with a certain level of trust.

To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a **mobile application** that enables citizens to submit photos of incidents. Additionally, a **web platform** is required for the city control center.

Moreover, the solution will integrate an **automatic verification system**, utilizing sensor-equipped (and autonomous) vehicles and urban cameras to confirm the resolution of incidents, ensuring that information remains up to date.

## Challenges
The project also aims to address several challenges associated with this type of application:

- **Avoiding duplicate reports**: Grouping similar complaints and avoiding redundant submissions to improve information management.
- **Enhancing classification accuracy**: Automating classification and descriptions for improved usability and reliability.
- **Integrating urban sensors and AI-based verification**: Leveraging ATCLL infrastructure, including PIXKIT, cameras, and LiDARs, for advanced data processing.
- **Scalability and adaptability**: Designing an efficient architecture that integrates seamlessly with existing platforms.
- **Event data acquisition and tracking**: Implementing a platform for incident reporting with precise location tracking.
- **Real-time notifications**: Providing timely updates to users to enhance engagement and responsiveness.
- **Usability and accessibility**: Conducting user experience tests to ensure intuitive interaction and broad accessibility.
- **Data security and privacy**: Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations for handling image data and incident reports.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Creating detailed documentation for future maintainability and platform evolution.

## Problem Statement
The primary problem our system aims to solve is the **lack of efficient and automated urban incident reporting and resolution**, which leads to delays in addressing issues and inaccurate status updates. Key features designed to address this include:

- **AI-Powered Incident Classification** to automatically categorize and describe incidents.
- **Duplicate Report Detection** to group similar complaints and prevent redundant submissions.
- **Automated Incident Verification** using urban sensors, cameras, and autonomous vehicles.
- **Real-Time Notifications** to keep users updated on incident status and resolution.

These features focus on delivering an intelligent, efficient, and user-friendly reporting system that benefits both citizens and city authorities.

## Differentiation
The **AI-Powered Platform for Smart City Issue Detection & Resolution** differentiates itself by emphasizing:

- **AI-Based Classification and Verification**: Utilizing computer vision models and sensor data to ensure high accuracy in incident identification and resolution.
- **Citizen and Sensor Integration**: Enabling reports from both individuals and distributed IoT devices for a comprehensive urban monitoring system.
- **Real-Time Updates and Notifications**: Keeping users informed about incident progress, fostering engagement and transparency.
- **Scalability and Adaptability**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab (ATCLL).

This approach sets it apart from **traditional reporting systems**, which often rely on manual processing, delayed verification, and lack of automated classification.

## Development Insights
The project concept emerged from **team collaboration** and **insights from professors and project advisors**, ensuring alignment with real-world needs. **User stories** outlining key features include:

- **Incident Submission**: Citizens and sensors can submit reports with images and location data.
- **AI Classification**: The system categorizes incidents automatically, reducing manual effort.
- **Verification System**: Autonomous vehicles and fixed sensors validate reported incidents.
- **City Control Center Dashboard**: A web platform for monitoring and managing incidents.
- **User Notifications**: Real-time alerts on incident progress and resolutions.

By integrating these elements, the project aims to enhance urban incident management, reduce response times, and improve the overall efficiency of city services.
